										<h2>So many uses for the set of all edges constituting an MST of a given graph...</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Like Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm finds the set of all edges constituting a 
										minimum weight spanning tree of a given graph.  From finding solutions to the 
										"travelling salesman" problem to perfect matching problems, Prim's algorithm and minimum
										weight spanning trees have an almost infinite number of uses.  It is important to note that a single
										graph may yield many minimum weight spanning trees, but they should all be of the same total weight,
										meaning the sum of all edge weights of any minimum weight spanning tree from graph G should be equal
										to the sum of all edge weights of any other minimum weight spanning tree from graph G.

										For this particular implementation of Prim's algorithm, the application is reliant upon reading from
										and writing to a file.  Please feel free to click on the "VIEW REPOSITORY" button at the bottom of 
										this page in the synopsis section for a full README file which will provide instructions on how to 
										use the application.

											<p>In order to achieve a time complexity of O(ElogV) where E = the number of 
												edges in the graph and V = the number of vertices in the graph in a greedy algorithm like Prim's, we need to use
												a priority queue.  The best way to do this is to implement a min binary heap that always
												maintains the highest priority element as the root node of the binary tree.  This means that 
												retrieving the edge in the queue with with the lowest weight simply requires O(1) time (constant time).  However,
												as with any binary heap, after retrieving this prioritized element from the queue and deleting it from the queue,
												the queue must be re-balanced.  This of course requires O(logV) time.

												<h3>Storing the Graph as an Adjacency List</h3>

											<p>Storing the graph as an adjacency list is a necessary component of this process.  
												The vertices in the graph are stored as an array of linked lists.  For example, index 1
												in the array represents vertex 1, and the array element stored at index 1 is itself a linked list
												composed of all vertices that are adjacent to vertex 1.  As is common in graph theory, 
												we use the word "adjacent" to simply mean "connected to vertex 1 by an edge".

												<h3>The Tried and True Linked List...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As mentioned above, the data structure used for storing the adjacency lists
												for this application is a bi-directional (doubly) linked list.  Allowing data to be stored in 
												non-contiguous blocks, using a linked list as a storage unit enables us to insert and delete
												data elements in whatever position we wish.  While this property was not actually needed for this application,
												I chose to use a linked list because I like to keep my skills current for basic commonly used
												data structure implementations like linked lists.  This doubly linked list keeps track of both
												relationships, i.e., when an edge (u, v) is encountered in the input file, v is added to u's adjacency list
												and u is also added to v's adjacency list.  Because of this, the time complexity of this particular
												implementation is slightly prolonged.  Even though this implementation of Prim's is certainly not
												as optimal as it could be, I chose certain implementations simply because they represented good exercises
												for me as a programmer.

												<h3>Prim's Algorithm Itself</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Prim's algorithm operates by maintaining a queue, (in this particular application's case,
												a priority queue), of all vertices in the graph.  The algorithm is effectively terminated
												when all vertices have been "deleted" from the queue because this means that each vertex
												in the graph has been visited, i.e., added to the set of edges representing a minimum 
												weight spanning tree of the given graph.  This set of edges is maintained throughout the execution of the 
												algorithm, and the queue is represented by an array of three - tuples, each of which is composed
												of the vertex number itself, its edge weight in relation to the last vertex 
												under consideration, and its parent vertex.  The algorithm picks a starting point node or vertex, and it is
												from this starting point that the algorithm branches out and greedily populates the 
												set of all edges constituting the minimum weight spanning tree.  In this particular implementation
												of the algorithm, that starting point vertex will always be vertex 1.

												The algorithm starts by initializing the edge weight of every vertex in the queue to infinity
												except for the starting point node or root node, which it initializes to 0, and the parent of every 
												vertex in the queue to null, using a loop to perform this operation.  It then begins its outer loop 
												by extracting the queue element with the minimum weight.  Of course, initially, this is the 
												starting point node, or vertex 1.  It then begins an inner loop that iterates through the adjacency list
												of the vertex that was just extracted from the queue.  It updates the edge weight field and parent vertex field
												of the vertex data objects in the queue that correspond with the vertices it encounters in the adjacency list
												it is examining.  It then adds the vertex under consideration to the minimum weight spanning tree set
												(only after the completion of the inner loop, of course) which it returns upon the completion of the algorithm
												as a whole.  In this way, Prim's algorithm uses a greedy methodology to construct a minimum weight spanning
												tree of a given graph.

										<h2>Synopsis</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Extracting the set of all edges composing a minimum weight spanning tree from a given graph and listing them
										is a very useful tool, and that is what this application accomplishes by implementing Prim's algorithm.  
										Using a minimum binary heap data structure as a priority queue in order to achieve constant time
										minimum weight edge retrieval, the complete run time of this application is O(ElogV) because each edge must 
										be iterated over, and each time a vertex is extracted from the binary heap, the binary heap must be rebalanced which
										requires logV time.  In the future, I plan to upgrade this application such that the min binary heap
										is replaced with a Fibonacci tree.
